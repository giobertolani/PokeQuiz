# PokeQuiz
A small and simple Java project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, year 2024.

This is a simple quiz game about Pokémon, the well-known japanese video game. The rules are simple: you have to answer 10 questions before the time runs out otherwise the game will go on by its own and you will get 0 points. At the end of the quiz you will get your total score and you could see the chart with the scores of the best players. In this repository, I uploaded all the code used to create and run the application. I used IntelliJ to write the Java parts and SceneBuilder to design and build the GUI. 

This is a simple game created to start practicing my Java programming knowledge in a deeper way. I know that something could be coded better and should be enhanced, but I'm kinda proud of it since it's my first solo programming project ever. Hope you like it too! :D
